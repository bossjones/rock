Description: This extension uses libmemcached library to provide API for 
 communicating with memcached servers.
 memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system,
 generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web 
 applications by alleviating database load.
 It also provides a session handler (memcached).
