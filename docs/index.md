# Documentation

RockStack is a collection of language runtimes and a command line tool
that allows developers to use modern technologies and encourages
"best practises".

## Setting up the Stack

Install options include a prebuilt Vagrant box and an Enterprise Linux YUM repository.

 * [Vagrant](/docs/install/vagrant/)
 * [Enterprise Linux](/docs/install/el/) - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS,
   Oracle Linux, Scientific Linux (SL), etc...

## Using Runtimes

Supported runtimes include multiple languages and versions and are isolated
from system installations and other rock runtimes.

Its easy and often recommended to run all the runtimes on a single box.
