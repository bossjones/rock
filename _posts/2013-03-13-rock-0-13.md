[rock 0.13][pypi] ([diff][diff]) released.

 - Remove subcommands
 - Add argument parsing
 - Add config command
 - Remove create command
 - Make SHELL configurable

## Subcommands

Sections defined as `rock_web` were run as

    rock run web

are now run as

    rock run_web

## Build Deployment

The build deployment command has changed from

    rock build deployment

to

    rock build --deployment

This also means that if you extended the `build` or `build_deployment` sections
you'll need to update these from something like

    build: |
      {{ '{{' }} parent }}
      make dev
      make static

    build_deployment: |
      {{ '{{' }} parent }}
      make prod
      make static

to

    build: |
      {{ '{{' }} parent }}
      if [[ "${ROCK_ARGS_DEPLOYMENT}" == "true" ]]; then
        make deployment
      else
        make dev
      fi
      make static

## Argument Parsing

rock now automatically parses and exposes command line arguments via environment
variables.

    $ rock test one --two three --four=4 five
    ...
    export ROCK_ARGV='one --two three --four=4 five'
    export ROCK_ARGS='one three five'
    export ROCK_ARG0='test'
    export ROCK_ARG1='one'
    export ROCK_ARG2='three'
    export ROCK_ARG3='five'
    export ROCK_ARGS_FOUR="4"
    export ROCK_ARGS_TWO="true"
    export ROCK_OPTS='TWO FOUR'
    ...

This works for any section except `run`, which just executes the run arguments
in your environment.

You can still define a `run` section, but it will only be executed if you type
`rock run` without any arguments.
